This is an assignment for my software foundation course.

## Introduction
Implement a command line text counting statistics program. It can correctly count the number of characters, words, and sentences in the imported pure English txt text. 

The specific command line interface requirements are as follows: 

Command mode: wc.exe [parameter] [file name] 

Example: 

- wc.exe -c file.txt &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;// Counts the number of characters.
- wc.exe -w file.txt &emsp;&emsp;// Counts the number of words.
- wc.exe -s file.txt &emsp;&emsp;// Counts the number of sentences.
- wc.exe -l file.txt &emsp;&emsp;// Counts the number of code lines and blank lines.
- wc.exe -h          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;// Display help information.
